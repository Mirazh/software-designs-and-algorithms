# 6. ðŸ“š Home Task

The home task should be done using TypeScript.

### Job runner

As an implementation of this home task you should create circular job runner. Each job must have a priority and should be run according to it. Priority could be set by randomizer. Job result is insignificant in terms of the h/w, for example it could be logging of job's priority in console. Job runner must handle at least 10000 jobs without noticeable performance issues.

Job runner is nothing more than a priority queue
