# ðŸ›  Importance of TypeScript knowledge for the course

There is an expectation that participants of the course know [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) on the basic level. Almost all code snippets presented in the course are written in TypeScript. So, why is TypeScript important for the course?

Exploring OOP and design patterns the following keywords are usually mentioned: [abstraction](https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2019/02/write-object-oriented-typescript-abstraction/), [types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-aliases), [interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#interfaces), [access modifiers](https://www.typescripttutorial.net/typescript-tutorial/typescript-access-modifiers/), [abstract Classes and Members](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html#abstract-classes-and-members), etc.

OOP and design patterns originate from the typed programming languages. JavaScript is not like that and does not have full coverage for the keywords at the moment. While it is possible to, sort of, implement them using JavaScript flexibility, it will look hacky, and it is not recommended for usage in production.

On the other hand, TypeScript was built specifically to provide the support for mentioned things and much more. And TypeScript [becomes more used and popular](https://postlight.com/insights/why-the-world-is-adopting-typescript) from year to year. Feel free to explore the provided links and if you would like to know more about TypeScript consider applying for dedicated [courses on learn portal](<https://learn.epam.com/explore?filter=~(isUserContent~false~sorting~(field~%27RATING~isDescending~true)~search~%27typescript)>).
